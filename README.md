# Inventory-Management

This is an Inventory Management System built in the form of a GUI desktop application developed in Java using MySQL as its database. The GUI was designed using Swing and the database connectivity was managed using JDBC API.

This application can be used by any small to mid-sized stores to easily maintain and manage an inventory of all their-

Products
Customers
Suppliers
Users
Transactions
Features of the Application
Users can manage inventory and stock of all the products available in their store.

Users can manage all sales and purchase transactions made by the store.

Supports two user types:

Administrator
Employee
[Admins have the ability to manage all other personnel.]

Any transaction made automatically handles the stock availability in the inventory.

Each section includes a search feature to make it easier for users to view the data they want to see.

Users only need to enter the product code while making a sale and all the relevant details will be retrieved from the database automatically.

Maintains a time log of all the users using the application.
